# odin-recipes
The goal is to build a basic recipe website consistying of a main index page that links to recipes.



Reflection
Putting this site together required knowledge of 
- unordered and ordered lists
- nesting of linked headers into unordered lists
- using href to link to other html files
- using <img src> tag to source images from the web
